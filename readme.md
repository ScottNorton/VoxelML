# VoxelML

VoxelML is a fully code-generated voxel engine built to push the boundaries of procedural content generation. 
The engine powers [VoxelML.com](https://voxelml.com), where the website itself acts as the engine, delivering a real-time voxel-based vr-capable experience directly in the browser.

## Features

- **100% Code-Generated Mesh and Geometry**: As a rule, every aspect of the engine is generated through code, presenting huge challenges with sweet results.
- **Voxel-Based Engine**: Designed for advanced voxel manipulation with custom data structures for high-performance rendering.
- **Procedural Content Generation**: VoxelML uses a bespoke procedural content generation system driven by .NET in WebAssembly with ML.NET for shape recognition.
- **Optimized Binary Serialization**: VoxelML employs runtime generated binary serialization methods for fast movement of memory between TypeScript, .NET, and network messages.
- **Web-Based Engine**: The engine is fully web-compatible, allowing users to experience voxel rendering directly in the browser using Three.js
