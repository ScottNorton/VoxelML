# VoxelML

VoxelML is a fully code-generated voxel engine built to push the boundaries of procedural content generation. 
The engine powers [VoxelML.com](https://voxelml.com), where the website itself acts as the engine, delivering a real-time voxel-based vr-capable experience directly in the browser.

## Features

- **100% Code-Generated Mesh and Geometry**: Every aspect of the engine is generated through code, offering complete control over the rendering pipeline.
- **Voxel-Based Engine**: Designed for advanced voxel manipulation, with custom data structures for high-performance rendering.
- **Procedural Content Generation**: VoxelML uses a bespoke procedural content generation system driven by custom algorithms like Maestro, ensuring unique and dynamic worlds.
- **Optimized Binary Serialization**: VoxelML employs binary serialization for fast, lean data transmission, keeping performance at its peak.
- **Web-Based Engine**: The engine is fully web-compatible, allowing users to experience voxel rendering directly in the browser using Three.js.
